The points below can be improved with a bit more optimization:
- Serving scaled images (some images are being resized in CSS e.g. logo.png)
- Leveraging browser caching
# Scalability
Using a back-end programming language and database, I'd like to have a fully featured CMS which can be used by non-technical people to create, read, update and delete data easily.
Also, I'd like franchise owners to have a private section where they can find resources and talk directly to our customer service representatives.
# Technologies
