# UX

I have used simple and responsive design to minimise loading time of the page.

- Home page: Home page contains Carusel with inner jumbotron for the main section and additional jumbotron bellow which could be resized depend on user viewport size.
- Contact page: Contact page contains a contact form with submit button and background image.
- Gallery Page: Contains photos with transform option when user hover over the picture and optional slide show when click on the image. To create desire effect js magnificPopup function was used.
- Timetable: Timetable contains clickable tabs with days of the week and container below with relevant content for each tab. Below there is a jumbotron with call to action botton.

In order to improve user experience and website loading speed, to  compressed the images i used [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) and the reduction in image size has been 67%.

![Website Speed Test Results](images/speed_test.png)
The points below can be improved with a bit more optimization:
- Serving scaled images (some images are being resized in CSS e.g. logo.png)
- Leveraging browser caching
# Scalability

Using a back-end programming language and database, I'd like to have a fully featured CMS which can be used by non-technical people to create, read, update and delete data easily.
Also, I'd like franchise owners to have a private section where they can find resources and talk directly to our customer service representatives.
